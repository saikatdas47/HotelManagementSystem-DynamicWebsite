The hotel management system is built using a combination of modern web technologies to ensure efficiency, scalability, and user-friendly interfaces.

PHP: The core of the system is developed using PHP, which handles server-side logic, data processing, and interaction with the database.
MySQL: MySQL is used for the database management system, storing all user data, room details, bookings, and payment information securely.
Bootstrap: For the front-end, Bootstrap is utilized to create a responsive and aesthetically pleasing user interface, ensuring the system is accessible across various devices.
JavaScript: JavaScript enhances the user experience with dynamic interactions and validations, making the system more interactive and responsive.
XAMPP: XAMPP is used as the local development environment, integrating Apache server, MySQL, PHP, and Perl, which makes it easier to develop and test the application.
These technologies together create a robust and efficient hotel management system that caters to the needs of users, admins, and guests effectively.
